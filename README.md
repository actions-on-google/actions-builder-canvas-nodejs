1. Install the [Firebase CLI](https://developers.google.com/assistant/actions/dialogflow/deploy-fulfillment)
    + We recommend using MAJOR version `8` , `npm install -g firebase-tools@^8.0.0`
    + Run `firebase login` with your Google account

### Setup
#### Actions Console
1. From the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com/), **New project** > **Create project** > under **What kind of Action do you want to build?** > **Game** > **Blank project for smart display**

#### Firebase Hosting Deployment
1. Run `firebase deploy --project {PROJECT_ID} --only hosting` to deploy the web app to Firebase Hosting
   + To find your Project ID: In the Actions Console console for your project, navigate to ⋮ > Project settings > Project ID.

1. Navigate to `sdk/webhooks/ActionsOnGoogleFulfillment/index.js`, and replace the place holder string `https://PROJECT_ID.web.app` of the `CANVAS_URL` variable with the URL to your own web app.

#### Actions CLI
1. Install the [Actions CLI](https://developers.google.com/assistant/actionssdk/gactions)
1. Once Actions CLI is installed, add the path of gactions into the `.bashrc` file to access gactions  from any file directory.
`export PATH="$PATH:<path_to_gactions>"` From more information refer to this answer [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45040330/5539913)
1. Navigate to `your_project_directory` and run `gactions init <PROJECT_NAME>` 
1. Navigate to `sdk/settings/settings.yaml`, and replace `<PROJECT_ID>` with your project ID
1. Navigate to the `sdk/` directory by running `cd sdk` from the root directory of this project.
1. Run `gactions login` to login to your account.

### Running this Sample
+ You can test your Action on any Google Assistant-enabled device on which the Assistant is signed into the same account used to create this project. Just say or type, “OK Google, talk to my test app”.
+ You can also use the Actions on Google Console simulator to test most features and preview on-device behavior.
